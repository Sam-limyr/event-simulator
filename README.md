# event-simulator

This Discrete Event Simulator outputs the service times of customers by servers, and was created for a school project.

The inputs include the number of servers and customers, as well as seeded values for randomized customer arrival times and server resting times. Relies upon a seeded random number generator in cs2030.simulator.RandomGenerator.
